#### A short sell and upgrade shop management game where the player sells sushi to npc's (customers).

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes that will satisfy the request involve two files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the exported `title` and `description` values to match the new game description.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new “todo” file that describes the logo image (a coin pouch icon) so an artist can generate it.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized coin pouch icon: a small pouch with a looped handle, filled with golden coins spilling out, set against a muted pastel background. The pouch is a rounded rectangle with a curved top, the handle is a thin line. Coins are depicted as small circles with a subtle shine, arranged in a loose pile inside the pouch. The overall composition is simple and clean, suitable for a game icon.
